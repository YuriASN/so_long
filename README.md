This is a simple 2D game following some rules on maps.
In this game you need to collect the cup of coffees in order to leave the place.
Why? Because we all need some cafeine to finish out projects.

This version runs with a pre-installed minilibX on the computer.
The version delivered to the project was working with the MLX being installed on this repository.

Found the best information about MiniLibX on: [Gontjarow](https://gontjarow.github.io/MiniLibX/)'s MiniLibx Github.
